# TicTacToe
Hey there! Here I have tried to implement my existing skills on data structures and combine them with my first ever android project to create an iconic game that everone knows - TicTacToe.

## Features
1. It is a 2 player offline game.
2. Customizable player names.
3. Indication for which player's turn is going on.
4. Change names.
5. Rest the game
